# Develop: build flow (Steps 1-4, after the Step 0 spec gate passes)

Read this once the Step 0 gate in `SKILL.md` clears (a decision is not owed, or the engineer chose to build anyway). Tracks are additive: a feature can be UI, Logical, or both (and may also carry a tooling sub task); classify in Step 1 and run each part.

Guide paths below (`ui-guide.md`, `logical-guide.md`, `checklist.md`) are relative to the develop skill folder (the parent of this `flow/` directory).

### Step 1: Classify the track

| Signals | Track |
|---|---|
| "page", "component", "screen", "layout", "ui"; a screenshot is attached; visual work against `design.md` | **UI** → `ui-guide.md` |
| "api", "endpoint", "service", "functionality", "logic", "data", "job", "webhook", "integration" | **Logical** → `logical-guide.md` |
| Both present (e.g. "auth": pages + session logic) | **Both**: run each track for its part |

If genuinely ambiguous, ask once: "Is this the UI, the logic behind it, or both?"

### Step 2: Load the decision and conventions (both tracks)

Read:
1. **The governing spec** (feature's `spec` pointer, or Step 0), build spec sections only: `## Requirements` (user stories + IDed acceptance criteria `AC-1…`; the contract, and the source of the Step 4 verify steps), `## Decision`, the design/spec section (`## Feature design` / `## Proposed stack` / spec table), `## Build plan` (ordered tasks tagged "satisfies AC-N"; the data model migration sized to the feature), `## Consequences` (constraints). Skip `## Context`, `## Options considered`, `## Rationale` (decision history, not build input) unless a constraint needs the reasoning. Umbrella `index.md` → read the index (decision + child list; `## Structure` maps every child; the index holds any cross child contract), then only the child spec(s) this sub task touches (usually one; a second only if it truly spans two, never all), build spec sections only. Never read the spec's `rationale.md` for a build. **Check the `Status`** (single file, or umbrella `index.md`; children carry none): `Proposed` → normal for a feature spec `/solution-architect` designed and linked (it means agreed, not yet built; `Accepted` is reserved for shipped), so build it and advance to `In Progress` (Step 3) with no warning. Pause to confirm only for a clearly unconfirmed draft (no scope link) or an unratified standalone decision spec. `Superseded` → use the superseding spec; `Assumed` → expected on a resumed build via the Step 0 escape hatch (a decision recorded but not deliberated): build against the recorded assumption and carry the ratify reminder into Step 4 (it does not block `done`; the `Assumed` flag stays until `/solution-architect` ratifies).
2. **The nearest `AGENTS.md`** to the target code area (Claude Code loads it automatically; read explicitly to be sure). It carries decisions synced from earlier features: don't ask again what's settled.
3. **`design.md`** (UI track only): the visual source of truth.
4. **The build approach**, precedence: the feature's scope row `Approach` override if declared, else the project default in root `AGENTS.md`, else the scope file's header. Strategies: vertical end to end slice, thinnest usable whole, UI shell first prototype wired later, full user journey per phase. Governs *how you assemble* the slice in Step 3, not *what* it contains (the spec fixes that). None recorded → default to a coherent end to end slice, every layer the feature spans (data → logic → interface → UI). Reason from the strategy's principle, not a fixed per approach recipe.
5. **Tool skills**: the spec's `## Decision` **Implementation skills** field names them (e.g. an ORM, an auth library); `AGENTS.md`'s `## Agent skills` section lists what's installed, one bullet per skill with its location. Open the `SKILL.md` (the path from that bullet or the spec field is real and readable) of each one materially governing the code you're about to write and follow its conventions. On demand only: just the skills this sub task touches, not all. On Claude Code a skill may activate on its own; read it explicitly anyway. Unreadable → build from the spec plus knowledge, note it.

**Monorepo: work inside the target workspace.** Workspaces config or `apps/*`/`packages/*` manifests → identify the feature's workspace (code pointer, or task path) and operate there: its nested `AGENTS.md` and `design.md`, its `package.json`/stack, write into its tree, run its commands (`dev`/`build`/`test`, scoped to that workspace, e.g. `<pkgmgr> --filter <workspace> …` or the monorepo task runner's filtered command). The checks before you start apply to that workspace; its scope is `docs/scope/<workspace>/`.

**Precedence on conflict:** the spec wins for the feature it governs (a feature specific override beats the project default); `AGENTS.md` is the general convention. Flag the conflict ("spec <NNNN> diverges from `AGENTS.md` on X, `/state-sync` should reconcile") rather than silently picking. spec silent on a point → `AGENTS.md` governs.

**Spec completeness check (before any code, not partway).** Two passes:

1. **Sections present:** logical → data model, API surface, security model, key invariants; UI → screens and their states. Missing or placeholder → ask (panel below).
2. **Input coverage (catches the silent decision):** enumerate every value each code path must produce or display for the ACs; for each, confirm the spec names its source (input, DB column, derivation, prior decision, the spec's **Value sourcing** table). A required value with **no named source** is a load bearing gap, the case the builder is tempted to fill as "local wiring": it decides the source of an AC constrained value, so treat it as a missing load bearing section and ask; never invent the source.

A gap → ask. Options depend on whether it is **load bearing** (data model, API surface, security model, provider, feature behavior, or an unnamed source for a required value) or a **local detail** the spec already governs (pagination size, sort order, label):

- **question**: "The spec for this is missing `<section>`. How do you want to proceed?"
- **header**: "spec gap"
- **Load bearing** → `Update the spec first` (recommended: paste ready `/solution-architect <feature>: fill in <section>`) · `Tell me the answer now` (persist it before building, below). `Use your best judgment` is NOT offered here (inventing one of these is `/solution-architect`'s call, and it must be persisted, not left in chat).
- **Local detail** → the above two, plus `Use your best judgment` (proceed on a stated assumption, surfaced in the report). Local only, never the load bearing list.

**Persist a load bearing answer before building** (`Tell me the answer now`), so a known decision never stays only in chat: deliberated spec (`Proposed`/`In Progress`/`Accepted`) → `/feature-build` can't write its content, route to `/solution-architect <feature>: fill in <section>` and resume. Already `Assumed` → append to its `## Assumption built on` (the one write `/feature-build` owns), then build. No spec (you passed Step 0 as "no real decision") → a decision is owed after all: back to the Step 0 panel (`Architect it first`, or `Build now, record it as an assumed spec` folding this answer in).

### Step 2.5: Explore before building (isolate the reading)

Locating files to touch and patterns/interfaces to match and reuse means reading code (every opened file stays in the main context all session). Isolate it in a read only subagent that returns a compact map (~1 to 2k tokens).

- **Skip it** when the change is tiny and you know the file, or on a fresh session where context is light.
- **Run it** when the reading would bloat the main context: a large or monorepo repo, many files, an unfamiliar area.

Spawn a read only exploration subagent (Claude Code: the `scout` subagent type, which pins a fast, low cost model; else Cursor `Explore`, Antigravity `research`, Codex `spawn_agent`; else a plain subagent, or inline if your agent has none). Where the type does not pin it, set a fast, low cost model explicitly, never the session model. Tools `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` only, no `Edit`/`Write`. Brief: target workspace, exact sub task, the spec's key interfaces; return only a compact map, files to create/edit (paths), patterns/conventions to match (`file:line`), symbols/types/helpers to reuse, and gotchas, no file contents or dumps.

Build from the map (Step 3): the reading is offloaded, the deciding and writing stay on the main thread.

**Large repos & monorepos:** hold the Step 0 read scope, one sub task per run, build inline.

### Step 2.6: Doc check (only when needed): offload current usage lookups to a web subagent

Only when you genuinely need the current usage/API of a tool the spec already decided (fast moving or newly released) and you're unsure your knowledge is current. Most builds don't need it: on a stable stack, build from knowledge and let the typecheck/build/lint loop catch a stale API. Never to choose or reconsider a tool (`/solution-architect`'s job): look up *how to use* the decided tool, not *whether*; if docs reveal it can't work, that's the "spec is wrong" path (Step 3), not a silent swap. Not a second fetch of the spec's reference links (human facing, verified at design time).

**How (capability first):** spawn a read only web subagent (on Claude Code the `researcher` type, which pins a fast, low cost model and carries the web tools; else your agent's web/browse tool), its model set explicitly to a fast, low cost tier (not the session model), briefed with the exact tools/versions from the spec and the one thing you need. Return only a compact usage summary (current call/config/setup, version notes, gotchas), never raw pages. No web capability → skip: build from knowledge, lean on the build/typecheck loop, note the assumption.

### Step 3: Resume check, then build

**Task source.** Governing spec → its `## Build plan` is the atomic checklist (tasks tagged with their AC; the data model migration sized to the feature, one or sliced per slice): build from it and tick progress there, the resume trail. The scope carries only the milestone rollup under the feature's `Build it: /feature-build <feature>` box (2 to 5 sub items), updated per Step 4; `Verify it` and `Test it` belong to `/verify-release` and `/test-engineer`. No spec → the scope checkboxes are the tasks.

**Build the coherent slice the approach calls for; don't silently skip surface.** Assemble as a senior build engineer per the Step 2 approach, and let the approach visibly shape the slice, not the same build relabeled (each strategy per Step 2). Reason from the principle, not a recipe; none recorded → the Step 2 end to end default. Cross check the task list against `## Requirements` (`AC-1…`) and the spec's API/UI surface before building: required but uncovered → flag it and add the task. Every `AC-N` is satisfied by a task you build, or explicitly deferred with the engineer's agreement.

**Resume first; never rebuild what's done.** Use the Step 0 scope file only (the workspace's, in a monorepo). Status **`existing`** (shipped) or **`dropped`** (dropped from scope) → not active: don't build it automatically; say it's marked `<status>` and confirm reviving/modifying (a new task, possibly needing a spec). Else find the first unchecked `[ ]` in the spec's `## Build plan` (or the scope checkboxes, no spec); `[x]` tasks are already built, don't redo them. Say where you pick up: "This feature is 4/10 done, resuming at *data integration*." Set the feature's status to `in-progress` (At a glance table and heading); a governing spec's `**Status**:` line advances `Proposed` → `In Progress` surgically per Artifact ownership (read it again first; not `Proposed` → flag, don't clobber). An **`Assumed`** spec is the exception: leave its status `Assumed` (do not advance it to `In Progress`), because the decision is not deliberated yet; only `/solution-architect` ratification clears `Assumed`. No scope → just build the requested task.

**Gather remaining inline answers** (the Step 2 spec gap answer, UI asset and design direction questions, an ambiguous business rule) before any build handoff; they need the engineer.

**With the Step 2.5 map in hand, the build is a write step done inline on the main thread.** Do not spawn a subagent to write code, even for a very large or multi file build; sequence it sensibly.

Tracks:

- **UI** → follow `ui-guide.md` inline (component or screen → stack/styling/dark mode detection → asset resolution → tokens → font → the five phases → accessibility); the main thread keeps design/asset questions responsive.
- **Logical: normal build** → inline per `logical-guide.md` (ground in the spec → data layer → core logic → interface → integration → correctness pass).
- **Logical: very large single build** → still inline. Work through it in ordered chunks per `logical-guide.md`, ticking `## Build plan` tasks as each lands and its typecheck passes; use `/compact` partway through the build if the single feature runs long (the scope and spec hold the state, so nothing is lost).
- **Logical: big rollout of an already decided pattern** (e.g. "swap inline inputs across 17 files") → still inline, sequenced to stay safe:
  1. **Primitive first**: build the shared thing (helper/module/schema) and confirm it typechecks before touching call sites.
  2. **Apply site by site**: work through the files in turn, applying `<primitive>` per the pattern the spec fixes, preserving exact behavior; tick each as it lands.
  3. **Gate once at the end**: package wide typecheck/lint and `/verify-release` after all sites are migrated, not after each. Remove the superseded code only on this green sweep (ALL sites migrated AND typecheck/lint passing): sites not migrated still reference it, deleting early breaks the build.
  4. **Partial progress; don't migrate only halfway**: if you stop before every site is done, keep the old code, leave the feature `in-progress`, report migrated versus pending sites explicitly (which files landed, which remain), and say running `/feature-build` again resumes the pending sites (it detects and skips migrated ones; idempotent and resumable). The old code comes out on the run where the last site lands green.
- **Both** → track order follows the build approach, not a fixed rule. Default (and for an end to end / tracer bullet slice): logical interface first so the UI binds to something real, then UI. Facade (UI shell first): UI on placeholder data first, wire the logical layer after.

**Spec wrong partway through the build → update the spec before patching; never silently diverge.** The spec proves wrong or incomplete partway through the build (e.g. the decided data model can't hold, or an acceptance criterion contradicts the API surface): if building correctly means deviating from the spec, STOP before coding the deviation, route to `/solution-architect` to update or supersede the spec (paste ready `/solution-architect <feature>: <what the spec got wrong>`), resume once the spec reflects reality.

**A data layer build isn't done until its migration is applied and verified**: generate the migration, run it against the target DB, confirm the schema is live (tables/columns/relationships exist; query the DB or its introspection, not just the migration file) before ticking. Generated but unapplied = not done. (`logical-guide.md`, Phase 2.)

**Remove superseded code; old and new must not coexist.** A build that replaces an existing pattern or implementation (a refactor, or an approach swapping rollout) includes the deletion: remove dead functions, unreachable branches, orphaned files, unused imports; verify nothing still references them (search for callers/imports; typecheck/build/lint clean with the old code gone). Old and new side by side = not done. Timing: single site → delete the moment the new code is in and typecheck is green; multi site rollout → per rollout points 3 and 4 above.

**Follow the spec's verify protocol.** If the spec specifies how to verify (common with no test runner, e.g. "`<pkgmgr> -F <pkg> typecheck` must pass after every sub task", or "diff API responses before/after"), run exactly that after each sub task/batch; a sub task isn't done until it passes. Don't assume a test suite exists.

### Step 4: Update the scope and report

- **Only mark what actually landed.** Confirm first: files written, code present and typechecking; data layer task → migration applied and schema confirmed live, not merely generated. Interrupted or half done sub task → leave the task unchecked, keep the feature `in-progress`, report exactly what's incomplete and why. Never mark a task `done` on an unverified or incomplete build.
- **Tick atomic tasks in the spec, milestones in the scope** (only what you verified built, only in the Step 0 scope file): each completed `## Build plan` task in the spec; a milestone sub box when its spec tasks are done; the `Build it` box when all milestones are done; fill the pointer line (`code in <path>`). No spec feature → tick its scope checkbox(es) directly. **Closing gate: report what you ticked in each file** (scope boxes + spec tasks/status), or say no scope row matched; never finish silently.
- **`done` is the engineer's call, never yours to gate.** Tick what you built. Then, once it landed and self checked (typecheck/build green; UI rendered if you could; migration applied and schema live), offer: mark it `done` now, or take the suggested next step first (below). If the feature has no `Verify it`/`Test it` box (a foundation or decision plus scaffold feature, or a `Prototype` build), `done` is the natural next move; if it has later boxes, note them as the suggested (skippable) next steps. Set `done` when the engineer says so, and record any skipped step as skipped. An `Assumed` governing spec does not block `done`: flag it ("built on an unratified decision, `/solution-architect` to ratify when you can") and let the engineer decide.
- **Mirror `done` onto the governing spec.** When the engineer marks the feature `done`, advance the `**Status**:` line `In Progress` → `Accepted`, surgically per Artifact ownership (read it again first; not `In Progress`, e.g. `Accepted`/`Superseded`/`Assumed` → flag, don't clobber). Whichever skill sets `done` mirrors this; if the engineer runs verify/test-engineer after `/feature-build`, that skill does it instead.
- **Emit verify steps, then ASK where they go (every run, never save automatically).** Derive concrete steps from the ACs, specific and each tied to its `AC-N` (e.g. "visit `/signup` → sign up → expect redirect to `/auth/verify-email` → AC-1"). **Also one step per row of the spec's Value sourcing table**, so the behavioral layer (the real correctness guarantee; the gate is only design time) exercises each value's source, especially the edge that breaks if it is wrong (vary the input, timezone, locale, currency, or tenant and check the output). This catches a mis sourced value (e.g. a day computed in the wrong timezone) even if the gate missed it. Present this panel; write `verify.md` only on "Save" (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code):
  - **question**: "Save these verify steps to the feature's `verify.md`, or just show them in this summary?"
  - **header**: "Save verify steps?"
  - **options**:
    1. `Save to verify.md`: "Recommended for data, auth, or higher risk features: a durable checklist `/verify-release` can run and `/test-engineer` can later lock." → write/append the steps to `verify.md` (below).
    2. `Just show in summary`: "Keep them inline in this report only; don't write a file." → include them in the report and stop.

  The tool appends "Other" as a free text option automatically. On **Save**, write/append `verify.md` beside the spec. Single file spec → promote it to a directory, `docs/specs/NNNN-feature.md` → `docs/specs/NNNN-feature/{index.md, rationale.md, verify.md}` (split the decision record sections Context/Options considered/Rationale/References into `rationale.md`, keep the build spec in `index.md`, never double the name), and repoint the scope feature's `spec` link to the new `…/index.md` path. Directory spec → drop `verify.md` in. Existing `verify.md` → append, don't clobber. Format (so `/verify-release` can consume it and `/test-engineer` can lock the durable steps):

  ```markdown
  # Verify: <feature> · spec NNNN · updated <date>
  _Steps derived from spec NNNN acceptance criteria. `/verify-release` runs these; `/test-engineer` locks the durable ones._
  ## UI / manual
  - [ ] <action> → <expected>        → AC-N
  ## Commands
  - [ ] `<command>` → <expected>     → AC-N
  ## Acceptance-criteria coverage
  - AC-1 … covered by step … · AC-2 … · …
  ```
- Relay the track's report (the `## /feature-build complete` block from `ui-guide.md` and/or `logical-guide.md`).
- **Suggest the next step from the scope; make clear it is optional.** Phrase it as an offer the engineer can take or skip, e.g. "Suggested next: `/verify-release <feature>`, or mark it done and move to the next thing, your call." The suggestion is this feature's **first unticked box**; all boxes ticked → point to the next feature. A feature with no `Verify it`/`Test it` box has none to suggest, just move on. Never present a stage as required, and never suggest a stage whose box is not on the feature.
  - **If the spec is `Assumed`**, suggest ratification first: `/solution-architect <feature>: ratify the assumed <decision>` (it can catch a wrong assumption before you build further on it), but it is still the engineer's call.
  - **No scope at all** (a one off `/feature-build`) → there are no boxes to read, so infer the tail from the effective tier (feature tier tag, else project `**Workflow:**` default, else the risk of the change): stop after the build for a throwaway change, else point to `/verify-release`, and to `/test-engineer` and a fresh model `/peer-review` as the risk rises.
  - `/state-sync` at merge promotes new area conventions into `AGENTS.md`.

  Always advise `/clear` before the next feature (state lives in files; long sessions cost more even when cached). Suggest `/compact` mid build if this feature runs long.

`/feature-build` builds; it does not run `/verify-release`, `/test-engineer`, `/state-sync`, or `/solution-architect` for you, it points; you decide.
