# Nvii Documentation

## Introduction

Nvii is a secure environment variable management platform designed for modern development teams. It provides end to end encryption, version control, and seamless collaboration for managing environment variables across your projects. With Nvii, you can track changes, rollback to previous versions, manage branches, and ensure your sensitive configuration data remains secure.

## Features

Nvii offers a comprehensive set of features including:

**Security**: End to end encryption for all environment variables, secure authentication, device based session management

**Version Control**: Complete history tracking, version rollback capabilities, branch management for different environments

**Collaboration**: Team based access control, conflict resolution, synchronized updates across devices

**Developer Experience**: Intuitive CLI commands, dry run capabilities, automated conflict detection

## Installation

Install Nvii globally using npm

```bash
npm install -g nvii
```

on linux:

```bash
sudo npm install -g nvii
```

## Getting Started

Before using Nvii, you need to authenticate and create or link a project. Here's a quick start workflow:

1. Login to your Nvii account: `nvii login`
2. Create a new project: `nvii new`
3. Push your environment variables: `nvii push`
4. Pull changes on other machines: `nvii pull`

## Authentication Commands

### Login

Authenticate and establish a secure session with Nvii. This command opens a browser window for authentication and stores your credentials locally.

```bash
nvii login
```

The login process generates a unique confirmation code and establishes a secure connection. Your credentials are stored in your home directory for subsequent CLI operations.

### Logout

Terminate your current session and clear authentication credentials from your local machine.

```bash
nvii logout
```

**Options:**

`-u, --username <username>`: Specify the username of the account to logout from

`-e, --email <email>`: Specify the email of the account to logout from

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive logout with confirmation
nvii logout

# Logout specific user by username
nvii logout --username johndoe

# Logout specific user by email
nvii logout --email john@example.com
```

### Whoami

Display information about the currently authenticated user, including username and email address.

```bash
nvii whoami
```

This command helps verify your authentication status and confirms which account you're currently using.

## Project Management Commands

### New

Initialize a new project and configure environment variable management. This command reads your local .env file, encrypts the contents, and creates a new project in the Nvii platform.

```bash
nvii new
```

The command will prompt you for:

**Project name**: A descriptive name for your project

**Project description**: Optional description explaining the project's purpose

After creation, your project is automatically linked to the current directory.

### Link

Connect the current directory to an existing remote project. This is useful when working on multiple machines or onboarding new team members.

```bash
nvii link
```

**Options:**

`-t, --token <id>`: Specify a project ID to connect to directly

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive project selection
nvii link

# Link to specific project by ID
nvii link --token abc123xyz
```

The link command creates a `.nvii` directory in your current folder containing the project configuration.

### Unlink

Disconnect the current directory from its linked remote project. This removes the local `.nvii` configuration directory.

```bash
nvii unlink
```

You'll be asked to confirm before the unlinking process completes. This operation only affects your local machine and doesn't delete the remote project.

## Environment Variable Operations

### Pull

Fetch and merge environment variables from the remote repository. This command retrieves the latest version from the server and updates your local .env file.

```bash
nvii pull
```

**Options:**

`-f, --force`: Force pull without conflict resolution prompts, automatically accepting remote values <br />
`-b, --branch <branch>`: Pull from a specific branch (default: main) <br />
`-dry, --dry-run`: Preview changes without applying them to your local file <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard pull with conflict resolution
nvii pull

# Force pull, accepting all remote changes
nvii pull --force

# Pull from development branch
nvii pull --branch development

# Preview changes without applying
nvii pull --dry-run
```

**Conflict Resolution:**

When conflicts are detected, Nvii will prompt you to choose between keeping your local value or accepting the remote value for each conflicting variable.

### Push

Upload local environment variable changes and create a new version. This command encrypts your local .env file and pushes it to the remote repository.

```bash
nvii push
```

**Options:**

`-m, --message <message>`: Provide a version description message <br />
`-b, --branch <branch>`: Push to a specific branch (default: main) <br />
`-dry, --dry-run`: Preview changes without uploading <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Push with inline message
nvii push --message "Added database credentials"

# Interactive push with prompt for message
nvii push

# Push to staging branch
nvii push --branch staging --message "Update API keys"

# Preview changes before pushing
nvii push --dry-run
```

The push command displays a summary of added, modified, and removed variables before creating the new version.

### Update

Synchronize local environment file with the latest remote version. This command updates your .env file to match the most recent version without interactive conflict resolution.

```bash
nvii update
```

This is useful for quickly syncing when you know the remote version should take precedence.

## Version Control Commands

### Log

Display version history and change log for the current project. This command shows all versions with their descriptions, authors, and timestamps.

```bash
nvii log
```

**Options:**

`-n, --limit <number>`: Limit the number of versions to display (default: 10) <br />
`--oneline`: Show condensed one line format for each version <br />
`--author <email>`: Filter versions by author email or name <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show last 10 versions
nvii log

# Show last 5 versions
nvii log --limit 5

# Compact one-line format
nvii log --oneline

# Filter by author
nvii log --author john@example.com

# Combine options
nvii log --limit 20 --oneline --author jane
```

**Output Formats:**

Default format shows detailed information including version ID, author, timestamp, and description message.

Oneline format provides a compact view: `<version-id> <date> <author> <message>`

### Rollback

Restore environment variables to a previous version state. This command updates your local .env file to match the content from a selected historical version.

```bash
nvii rollback
```

**Options:**

`-v, --version <id>`: Specify a version ID to rollback to directly <br />
`-f, --force`: Skip confirmation prompts <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive version selection
nvii rollback

# Rollback to specific version
nvii rollback --version abc123def456

# Rollback without confirmation
nvii rollback --version abc123def456 --force
```

The rollback command displays available versions and asks for confirmation before updating your local file. This operation doesn't delete any versions, it simply updates your working copy.

### Merge

Consolidate multiple environment variable versions into the main branch. This command helps merge changes from feature branches back into your main branch.

```bash
nvii merge
```

**Options:**

`-s, --source <branch>`: Source branch to merge from <br />
`-t, --target <branch>`: Target branch to merge into (default: main) <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Merge with prompts
nvii merge

# Merge development into main
nvii merge --source development --target main
```

## Branch Management Commands

### Branch

Create a new branch from the current or specified version. Branches allow you to maintain separate environment configurations for different environments like development, staging, and production.

```bash
nvii branch
```

**Options:**

`-n, --name <name>`: Specify the branch name <br />
`-v, --version <id>`: Base version ID to branch from (default: latest version) <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create branch interactively
nvii branch

# Create named branch from latest version
nvii branch --name development

# Create branch from specific version
nvii branch --name hotfix --version abc123def
```

Branch names can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, hyphens, and slashes.

### Branches

List all branches for the current project. This command displays all available branches with their base versions and creation dates.

```bash
nvii branches
```

The output shows:

Active branches marked with an asterisk <br />
Current branch you're working on <br />
Base version ID for each branch <br />
Creation timestamp <br />

### Checkout

Switch to a different branch. This command updates your local configuration to work with a specified branch.

```bash
nvii checkout
```

**Options:**

`-n, --name <name>`: Branch name to switch to

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive branch selection
nvii checkout

# Switch to specific branch
nvii checkout --name development
```

After switching branches, your subsequent push and pull operations will target the selected branch.

## Version Tagging Commands

### Tag

Create a new tag for the current or specified version. Tags provide named references to specific versions, useful for marking releases or significant milestones.

```bash
nvii tag
```

**Options:**

`-n, --name <name>`: Tag name to use <br />
`-v, --version <id>`: Version ID to tag (default: latest version) <br />

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create tag interactively
nvii tag

# Create named tag for latest version
nvii tag --name v1.0.0

# Create tag for specific version
nvii tag --name production-release --version abc123def
```

Tag names can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens. They're commonly used for semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.1.3).

### Tags

List all tags for the current project. This command displays all tags with their associated version IDs, descriptions, and creation dates.

```bash
nvii tags
```

The output includes tag names, linked version IDs, optional descriptions, and timestamps.

## Utility Commands

### Generate

Create a template .env file from your current environment variables. This command generates an example file with variable names but empty values, perfect for sharing with team members or documenting required variables.

```bash
nvii generate
```

**Options:**

`-o, --output <file>`: Specify output file path (default: .env.example) <br />
`--format <type>`: Choose output format: env, json, or yaml (default: env)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate .env.example file
nvii generate

# Generate with custom output path
nvii generate --output .env.template

# Generate JSON format
nvii generate --format json

# Generate YAML format
nvii generate --format yaml --output config.yaml
```

**Output Formats:**

`env`: Standard .env file format with empty values

`json`: JSON object with variable keys and empty string values

`yaml`: YAML format with variable keys and empty values

### Test

Verify encryption and decryption functionality. This command tests the encryption system by encrypting your environment variables and then decrypting them, displaying both versions.

```bash
nvii test
```

This is primarily used for debugging and verifying that the encryption system is working correctly with your credentials.

## Best Practices

**Version Messages**: Always provide descriptive messages when pushing changes, similar to git commit messages

**Branch Strategy**: Use branches for different environments (development, staging, production)

**Regular Syncing**: Pull changes before starting work and push when done to keep your team synchronized

**Dry Run First**: Use the dry run flag to preview changes before applying them, especially with pull operations

**Tag Releases**: Create tags for production releases to easily rollback if needed

**Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts occur, carefully review each variable to choose the correct value

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up a New Project

```bash
# Login to Nvii
nvii login

# Create a new project
nvii new

# Push your initial environment variables
nvii push --message "Initial environment setup"
```

### Joining an Existing Project

```bash
# Login to Nvii
nvii login

# Link to the project
nvii link

# Pull the environment variables
nvii pull
```

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start of day: pull latest changes
nvii pull

# Make changes to your .env file
# ...

# End of day: push your changes
nvii push --message "Updated database connection strings"
```

### Managing Multiple Environments

```bash
# Create branches for different environments
nvii branch --name development
nvii branch --name staging
nvii branch --name production

# Switch to development
nvii checkout --name development

# Push changes to development
nvii push --message "Dev environment config"

# Switch to production
nvii checkout --name production

# Pull production config
nvii pull
```

### Rolling Back After a Mistake

```bash
# View recent changes
nvii log --limit 10

# Rollback to a previous version
nvii rollback --version abc123def

# Or use interactive selection
nvii rollback
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you're having trouble logging in, try logging out first and then logging in again:

```bash
nvii logout
nvii login
```

### Project Not Linked

If you see "Project not linked" errors, ensure you've linked your project:

```bash
nvii link
```

### Conflicts During Pull

If you encounter conflicts, you can either resolve them interactively or force pull with the remote values:

```bash
# Interactive resolution
nvii pull

# Force accept remote values
nvii pull --force
```

### Missing Environment File

Ensure you have a .env or .env.local file in your current directory before running commands like push or generate.

## Security Considerations

**Encryption**: All environment variables are encrypted using end to end encryption before transmission

**Device Authentication**: Each device requires separate authentication for security

**Local Storage**: Credentials are stored securely in your home directory

**Access Control**: Project access is managed through team permissions

**Version History**: All changes are tracked and can be audited
